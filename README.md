# Welcome to My Open The Iris
***

## Task

The problem is to predict the class of an iris plant based on its characteristics. 
The challenge lies in effectively analyzing the dataset, 
selecting appropriate algorithms, and accurately predicting the class labels.

## Description

The problem is solved by performing an end-to-end analysis of the iris dataset. The steps involved are:

Loading the dataset using pandas.
Summarizing the dataset by printing its shape, the first few rows, statistical summary, and class distribution.
Visualizing the dataset through univariate and multivariate plots using matplotlib.
Evaluating multiple algorithms for prediction, including DecisionTree, GaussianNB, KNeighbors, LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminant, and SVM.
Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
Assessing the accuracy of each model using cross-validation.

## Installation

There is no specific installation required for this project. However, Jupyter is recommended as the environment for running the code.


## Usage
The project follows these steps:
Load the dataset using the provided function load_dataset().
Summarize the dataset using the function summarize_dataset(dataset).
Print and plot univariate and multivariate visualizations using the functions print_plot_univariate(dataset) and print_plot_multivariate(dataset).
Evaluate and test multiple models using the function my_print_and_test_models(dataset).
